## Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for Question Answering (QA) tasks. The system enables users to ask questions and retrieve accurate, context-aware answers from a collection of AI research papers. The approach combines document retrieval with language generation to improve the quality of responses.

### Key Features
- Document preprocessing: Load, chunk, and vectorize research papers.
- Retrieval system: Efficiently retrieves relevant information based on user queries.
- Answer generation: Integrates a language model to provide coherent answers.
- Source attribution: References the correct sections of the research papers for transparency.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-qa-system.git
   cd rag-qa-system

Hereâ€™s a structured README file for your project titled **"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Question Answering"**. You can customize it further based on your specific implementation details and preferences.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-qa-system.git
   cd rag-qa-system
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - PyPDF2
  - sentence-transformers
  - transformers
  - scikit-learn

## Usage
To run the RAG system, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Input
You can input your questions in the console, and the system will return the most relevant answers along with source attributions.

### Example Questions
- What are the main components of a RAG model?
- Explain how positional encoding is implemented in Transformers and why it is necessary.
- Describe the concept of multi-head attention in the Transformer architecture.

## System Architecture
The architecture of the RAG system consists of the following components:

1. **Document Preprocessing**: 
   - Load and extract text from PDF research papers.
   - Chunk the text into manageable segments.
   - Vectorize the chunks for retrieval.

2. **Retrieval System**: 
   - Implemented using cosine similarity to find the most relevant text chunks based on user queries.

3. **Answer Generation**: 
   - Utilizes a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3) to generate answers based on retrieved chunks.

4. **Source Attribution**: 
   - Ensures that the generated answers reference the appropriate sections of the research papers.

## Testing the System
To test the system, you can use the provided sample questions or input your own. The system will retrieve relevant information and generate answers accordingly.

## Contributing
